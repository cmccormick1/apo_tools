# apo_tools

This is a repository of various tools that I use to work with, analyze and visualize APOGEE data.

## galcoords.py

galcoords.py contains functions to convert between observed values in equatorial coordinates, such as RA, Dec, distance, radial velocity and proper motion to galactic coordients, or to convert galactic coordinates to the Sagittarius coordinate system as defined by Majewski et al. 2003 and Law and Majewski 2010.

## spec_tools.py

spec_tools.py contains functions to work with APOGEE spectra, such as opening or downloading spectra from the web and tools to read APOGEE spectra files, mask empty pixels, and convert between vacuum and air wavelengths.
